🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict car prices using a Linear Regression Classifier. It walks through the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making predictions, all implemented in Jupyter Notebook.

📄 Project Overview
Predicting car prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and businesses in the automotive sector. Using a Linear Regression Model, this project analyzes car features to forecast their prices accurately.

🛠️ Workflow
1. Dataset Extraction
Sourced the dataset from Kaggle, which includes features such as car specifications and prices.
2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values, removed redundant columns, and treated outliers to improve data quality.
3. Data Transformation
Encoded categorical features and normalized numerical values for better model performance.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed correlations and identified key features impacting car prices through visualizations.
5. Data Splitting
Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
6. Model Building
Implemented a Linear Regression Classifier using the scikit-learn library.
7. Prediction
Predicted car prices on the test dataset and evaluated the model using performance metrics.
📊 Results
Achieved accurate price predictions.
Evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
