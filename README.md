# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict car prices using a machine learning model based on a **Linear Regression Classifier**. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent data cleaning, transformation, and analysis before applying the model.

## 📁 Dataset
- Extracted from **Kaggle**.
- The dataset includes information about car features and prices.

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure quality and accuracy.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explored data trends and visualized important features affecting car prices.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Applied **Linear Regression** for predicting car prices.
4. **Prediction**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance and made accurate predictions on test data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and analysis.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization.
